# API Integration (Generic)

- Prefer finding OpenAPI/Swagger spec; store it in `references/` (not pasted into chat).
- Implement:
  - timeouts
  - retries with backoff
  - idempotency where required
  - clear error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)
- Keep a project overlay skill `api-<vendor>` with endpoints used by the project.
